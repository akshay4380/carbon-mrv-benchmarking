# üåç Carbon MRV Benchmarking Review

## Overview
This project benchmarks carbon Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) methodologies used in forest carbon projects. It compares leading standards and literature-based methods on criteria such as accuracy, transparency, cost, and scalability.

## What is MRV?
MRV systems are essential for verifying that carbon projects deliver real, measurable climate benefits. They track forest restoration, carbon sequestration, and policy impacts over time.

## MRV Methods Compared
- Verra (VCS)
- Gold Standard
- Plan Vivo
- REDD+ Programs
- Peer-reviewed Scientific Approaches

## Key Takeaways
- No single method fits all contexts; tradeoffs exist between cost and accuracy.
- Community-driven models like Plan Vivo excel in transparency but may lack scale.
- Verra and Gold Standard offer high accuracy with greater infrastructure needs.
- REDD+ programs vary significantly depending on national capacity.
